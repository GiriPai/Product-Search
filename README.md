# Quinbay - Product Search Assessment

This tiny application is build with React and Bootstrap.

This application is hosted in Netlify. Click [here](https://quinbay-product-search.netlify.app/) to visit this application.

To keep this application light and simple, I haven't used some very useful third-party libraries Typescript, Material-UI or State-Managers. However I would recommend migrating to these stacks as we build on top of this application

## Third party libraries (other than React)

- Bootstrap v5.2
- Axios
- React Responsive Carousal

## Features

This application uses lazy loading to load search results. This means, as and when you reach the last product, an api call will fire requesting for next set of results.

## Running in local browser

To run this application in local browser, make sure to add Access-Control-Allow-Origin plugin to your browser and turn it on.
